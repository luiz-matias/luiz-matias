I'm a Software Engineer focused on Mobile technologies, using mainly Android to develop solutions for companies that have large and worldwide apps.

Besides mobile development, I also worked for a few months with Spring Boot to develop API's (and still use it to develop personal projects and keep up to date with the stack) and I'm currently learning fullstack technologies such as React and NextJS (to develop frontend websites and mobile apps) so I can be fully autonomous to implement end-to-end solutions.

I have 8 years of experience with software development, guaranteeing me deep tech knowledge and self-sufficiency to deliver high quality solutions.

I'm currently based in Brazil working remotely with teams around the entire America (US, Canada and LATAM), and interested in continuing to evolve as a developer by helping companies creating and maintaining high-scalable systems with international impact, regardless of location.

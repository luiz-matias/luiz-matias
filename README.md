I'm a **Software Engineer** focused on **Mobile** technologies, using mainly **Android** to develop solutions for companies that have large and worldwide apps.

I have **more than 6 years experience** with software development, guaranteeing me a deep tech knowledge and also several soft skills such as teamwork, intrapreneurship and autonomy to learn by myself.

Nowadays, I'm interested to keep evolving as a developer by helping companies to create, evolve and maintain high-scale apps with international impact, regardless of the location.

I'm a Software Engineer focused on Mobile technologies, using mainly Android to develop solutions for companies that have large and worldwide apps.

I have 7 years of experience with software development, guaranteeing me deep tech knowledge and several soft skills such as communication, teamwork, intrapreneurship, and autonomy to learn by myself.

I'm currently based in Brazil and interested in continuing to evolve as a developer by helping companies create and maintain high-scale apps with international impact, regardless of location.

I'm open to considering sponsored visa opportunities in Europe and North America. Let's get in contact!
